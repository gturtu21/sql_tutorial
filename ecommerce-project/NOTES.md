# ðŸ“˜ SQL Notes: WHERE vs HAVING

## ðŸ”¹ WHERE
- Filters **rows before grouping**.
- Cannot use aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.).
- Used for conditions on **raw row values**.

Example:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ HAVING
- Filters **groups after grouping/aggregation**.
- Can use aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.).
- Usually follows `GROUP BY`.

Example:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS num_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Both Together
You can use `WHERE` and `HAVING` in the same query:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS num_orders
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'     -- filter rows
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;                -- filter groups
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Special Case: HAVING without GROUP BY
If no `GROUP BY` is given, the whole result set is treated as **one implicit group**.

Example:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

---

## âœ… Rule of Thumb
- Filter **rows** â†’ use `WHERE`.
- Filter **aggregates/groups** â†’ use `HAVING`.
